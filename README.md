Note this repo only includes models for RSII chemistries, recent Sequel / Sequel II data should be analized with a recent version of SMRT Analysis https://www.pacb.com/support/software-downloads/

Tools for detecting DNA modifications from single molecule, real-time (SMRT&reg;) sequencing data. This tool implements the P_ModificationDetection module in SMRT&reg; Portal, used by the RS_Modification_Detection and RS_Modifications_and_Motif_Detection protocol. Researchers interested in understanding or extending the modification detection algorthims can use these tools as a starting point.
